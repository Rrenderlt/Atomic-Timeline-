    <!-- Democritus -->
    <div class="timeline-item">
      <div class="scientist-name">Democritus (460–370 BC)</div>
      <div class="year">Ancient Greece</div>
      <img src="images/democritus.jpeg" alt="Democritus Portrait">
      <div class="discovery">
        Proposed that all matter is made up of indivisible and indestructible particles called “atomos.” 
        He believed these atoms differed only in size, shape, and arrangement, which explained the variety of materials around us. 
        Although his theory was purely philosophical with no experimental evidence, it introduced the first concept of the atom, 
        shaping future scientific thought on matter and its composition.
      </div>
      <div class="experiment">
        <strong>Approach:</strong> Purely philosophical reasoning; no practical experiment conducted, as scientific tools were not yet developed.

    <!-- Dalton -->
    <div class="timeline-item">
      <div class="scientist-name">John Dalton (1803)</div>
      <div class="year">England</div>
      <img src="images/dalton.jpeg" alt="Dalton Portrait">
      <div class="discovery">
        Introduced the first scientific atomic theory: all matter consists of indivisible atoms 
        that combine in whole-number ratios to form compounds. 
        <br><br><strong>Postulates:</strong>
        <br>1️⃣ All matter is made of atoms — tiny, indivisible particles.  
        <br>2️⃣ Atoms of the same element are identical.  
        <br>3️⃣ Atoms combine in simple whole-number ratios to form compounds.  
        <br>He based his theory on careful measurements of gas reactions, making him the father of modern atomic theory.
      </div>
      <div class="experiment">
        <strong>Experiment:</strong> Studied gas behavior and formulated the <em>Law of Partial Pressures</em>, measuring gas reactions and pressures.   
        His discovery was indirect, inferred through chemical data.

    <!-- Goldstein -->
    <div class="timeline-item">
      <div class="scientist-name">Eugen Goldstein (1886)</div>
      <div class="year">Germany</div>
      <img src="images/goldstein.jpeg" alt="Goldstein Portrait">
      <div class="discovery">
        Discovered <strong>canal rays</strong>, or streams of positively charged particles, which were later identified as protons. 
        His research revealed that atoms contain positive charges in addition to the known negative ones. 
        Goldstein’s findings served as the first step toward understanding the internal structure of the atom and paved the way 
        for the later identification of protons by Rutherford.
      </div>
      <div class="experiment">
        <strong>Experiment:</strong> Used a <em>discharge tube with a perforated cathode</em>, allowing positive rays to pass through. 
        He observed glowing streams traveling in the opposite direction to cathode rays, proving the existence of positive particles within atoms.

    <!-- Thomson -->
    <div class="timeline-item">
      <div class="scientist-name">J.J. Thomson (1897)</div>
      <div class="year">England</div>
      <img src="images/thomson.jpeg" alt="Thomson Portrait">
      <div class="discovery">
        Discovered the <strong>electron</strong>—a negatively charged subatomic particle—through his study of cathode rays. 
        Thomson proposed the <em>“Plum Pudding Model”</em>, which depicted electrons scattered within a sphere of positive charge, 
        similar to raisins in a pudding. His work proved that atoms are divisible, challenging Dalton’s idea of indivisible atoms 
        and opening the door to the study of subatomic particles.
      </div>
      <div class="experiment">
        <strong>Experiment:</strong> Cathode Ray Tube Experiment — Thomson passed electric current through a low-pressure gas, 
        observing rays deflected by magnetic and electric fields, indicating they carried a negative charge.

      <div class="year">New Zealand / England</div>
      <img src="images/rutherford.jpeg" alt="Rutherford Portrait">
      <div class="discovery">
        Discovered the <strong>atomic nucleus</strong> and proposed the <em>Nuclear Model</em>, where most of the atom’s mass 
        is concentrated in a small, dense, positively charged center. 
        His discovery revolutionized atomic theory and overturned the Plum Pudding Model by showing that electrons orbit 
        around a central nucleus instead of being embedded within the atom.
      </div>
      <div class="experiment">
        <strong>Experiment:</strong> Gold Foil Experiment — Rutherford fired alpha particles at thin gold foil. 
        Most passed through, but a few deflected sharply, proving the existence of a compact nucleus.

    <!-- Bohr -->

      <div class="scientist-name">Niels Bohr (1913)</div>
      <div class="year">Denmark</div>
      <img src="images/bohr.jpeg" alt="Bohr Portrait">
      <div class="discovery">
        Proposed the <strong>Bohr Model</strong> of the atom, stating that electrons orbit the nucleus in specific, quantized energy levels. 
        When electrons jump between these levels, they absorb or emit energy as light. 
        This model explained the distinct spectral lines of hydrogen and provided the first link between atomic structure and quantum theory.
      </div>
      <div class="experiment">
        <strong>Experiment:</strong> Studied the emission spectrum of hydrogen gas. 
        The pattern of spectral lines matched the predicted energy differences between electron levels in his model.

    <!-- de Broglie -->
    <div class="timeline-item">
      <div class="scientist-name">Louis de Broglie (1924)</div>
      <div class="year">France</div>
      <img src="images/broglie.jpeg" alt="de Broglie Portrait">
      <div class="discovery">
        Proposed the concept of <strong>wave-particle duality</strong>, suggesting that all matter, including electrons, 
        exhibits both particle-like and wave-like properties. 
        This theory helped explain why electrons can only occupy certain stable orbits and contributed to the development 
        of quantum mechanics. His work bridged the gap between classical physics and quantum theory.
      </div>
      <div class="experiment">
        <strong>Experiment:</strong> Theoretical proposal later confirmed by the <strong>Davisson–Germer experiment</strong>, 
        where electrons produced diffraction patterns — direct evidence of their wave nature.

      <div class="scientist-name">Erwin Schrödinger (1926)</div>
      <div class="year">Austria</div>
      <img src="images/schrodinger.jpeg" alt="Schrodinger Portrait">
      <div class="discovery">
        Developed the <strong>Quantum Mechanical Model</strong> of the atom. 
        Schrödinger proposed that electrons do not follow fixed orbits but exist in regions of probability called <em>orbitals</em>. 
        His equation describes how the electron’s wave function evolves, predicting the areas where electrons are most likely found. 
        This model remains the foundation of modern atomic theory.
      </div>
      <div class="experiment">
        <strong>Approach:</strong> Used mathematical wave equations to describe electron motion and behavior within the atom, 
        creating visualizations that show electron density clouds rather than defined paths.

      <div class="year">England</div>
      <img src="images/chadwick.jpeg" alt="Chadwick Portrait">
      <div class="discovery">
        Discovered the <strong>neutron</strong>, a neutral particle within the nucleus, explaining why atomic masses were 
        greater than the number of protons alone. His work completed the modern understanding of atomic structure 
        and laid the foundation for nuclear physics, including atomic energy and radioactivity research.
      </div>
      <div class="experiment">
        <strong>Experiment:</strong> Bombarded beryllium with alpha particles, releasing a neutral radiation that could knock protons 
        out of other elements. He concluded that this radiation consisted of uncharged particles — neutrons.
